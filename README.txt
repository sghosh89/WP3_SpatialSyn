About:
	This repository records the complete workflow that produced the analysis from the data. 
	Each folder contains a "README.txt" to guide through the repository. We used the data extracted from 
	several publicly available databases (e.g., Breeding Bird Survey: https://doi.org/10.5066/P9J6QUF6; 
	CHELSA: https://chelsa-climate.org/, AVONET: Tobias et al. 2022; BirdTree: https://birdtree.org/).
	The core software dependency is R (R Core Team, 2025. R: A language and environment for statistical computing. 
	R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. URL https://www.R-project.org/.). 
	Codes are written and performed by Ghosh with R version 4.5.1 on a windows 11 laptop. This repository is intended
	to record a workflow, and is not designed or tested for distribution and wide use on multiple platforms. 
	For any reproducibility issue, you may contact S. Ghosh at ghoshshyamolina89@gmail.com 

Funding and acknowledgement:

	SG and OP were supported by funding from UZH. SG would like to thank ISI for institutional support and Dr. Imran Khaliq for the helpful 
	discussion on phylogeny and feedbacks on the initial draft.
