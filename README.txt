About:
	This repository records the complete workflow that produced the analysis from the data. 
	Each folder contains a "README.txt" to guide through the repository. We used the data extracted from 
	several publicly available databases (e.g., Breeding Bird Survey: https://doi.org/10.5066/P9J6QUF6; 
	CHELSA: https://chelsa-climate.org/, AVONET: Tobias et al. 2022; 
	EltonTraits: Wilman et al. 2014; BirdTree: https://birdtree.org/).
	The core software dependency is R (R Core Team, 2022. R: A language and environment for statistical computing. 
	R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. URL https://www.R-project.org/.). 
	Codes are written and performed by Ghosh with R version 4.2.1 on a windows 10 laptop. This repository is intended
	to record a workflow, and is not designed or tested for distribution and wide use on multiple platforms. 
	For any reproducibility issue, you may contact S. Ghosh at ghoshshyamolina89@gmail.com 

Funding and acknowledgement:

	SG and OP were supported by funding from UZH. SG would like to thank Dr. Imran Khaliq for the helpful 
	discussion on phylogeny and feedbacks on the initial draft.
