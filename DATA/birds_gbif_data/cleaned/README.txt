birds_occurrence_metadata_added_manual.csv file has all metadata information about gbif data downloaded and cleaned for
264 species occurred within 0-250Km distance category.
Later we used these file to compute optimal niche (with bio1, bio12) for 254 unique species (according to column BirdTreeName),
as we constructed the phylogenetic tree for those 254 species.
